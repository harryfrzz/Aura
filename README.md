## Aura is a Chrome extension which is be used to beautify your home page and make it your own :sparkles:

It is built using pure HTML,CSS and Javascript making it easier for developers to add new features.
It uses local storage for storing data, like the custom links that users add to the customisation choices that the user have made.

### Aura currently have the following customisation features :art: :
* **Clock customisation** - Users can change the fonts of the clock to any of the fonts that are given in the extension.
* **Clock format changer** - Users can change the clock format to 12 hour or 24 hour according to their preference.
* **Date format changer** - Users can change the date format from Normal format ie; Wednesday,19 June or the text format ie; It’s Wednesday.

### Features that will be implemented in the future :dart: :
* **Widgets integration** 
* **Spotify api integration** 
* **Date and Time placement changer** (Added)
* **And more customisation options !**

## NOTE :pushpin: 
* The public app currently uses unsplash image api to fetch images and show it as the background,but it’s not included in the open source version. So You can add whatever background as you like.
* The chrome manifest file is also not included with the source code, you have to create a manifest file by your own when building this extension.
## Contributions :hearts:
*Curruntly this project does not support any contribution,but will be allowed after some time.*
