## Aura is a Chrome extension which is be used to beautify your home page and make it your own :sparkles:

It is built using pure HTML,CSS and Javascript making it easier for developers to add new features.
It uses local storage for storing data, like the custom links that users add to the customisation choices that the user have made.

### Aura currently have the following customisation features :art: :
* **Clock customisation** - Users can change the fonts of the clock to any of the fonts that are given in the extension.
* **Clock format changer** - Users can change the clock format to 12 hour or 24 hour according to their preference.
* **Date format changer** - Users can change the date format from Normal format ie; Wednesday,19 June or the text format ie; It’s Wednesday.

### Features that will be implemented in the future :dart: :
* **Widgets integration** 
* **Spotify api integration** 
* **Date and Time placement changer**
